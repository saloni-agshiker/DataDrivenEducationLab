## 🚀 Inspiration & Goals

Georgia Tech utilizes a variety of digital platforms to foster education from our learning management systems (LMS) to Piazza discussion forums to MOOC platforms such as Coursera and edX. These platforms generate myriad data points about the trajectory of learning, ranging from content and video consumption to forum participation to assessments of learning to background characteristics of the learners. However, much of this information goes unused both in terms of research for understanding learners and for improving instruction.

This team focuses on the effects that data are having in shaping education, on how new, rich, educational data sources can be used to improve content, instruction, and learning. Specifically, we look to the vast array of data that can be collected around educational opportunities at Georgia Tech and how those data shape educational practice.
